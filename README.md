# One App to Rule Them All
The goal of this app is simple: extract random quotes from *The Lord of the Rings* and send them in text messages on a regular basis.

## Why?
One of my instructors at General Assembly told me about a weather app he had built one weekend. That app sent him a text message every morning with the weather in his area. I thought that sounded cool, and thought that building a similar app would be instructive. I decided to use quotes from *The Lord of the Rings* because I don't find the weather very interesting.
